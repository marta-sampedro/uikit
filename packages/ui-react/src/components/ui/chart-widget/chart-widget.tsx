// A dashboard chart widget: the Card every chart mockup is wrapped in, plus the
// one thing a Card doesn't know about — what the body shows while there is no
// plot to show.
//
// Deliberately thin. `CardHeader` already owns the whole header surface (title,
// description, extras, actions, drag handle, switch, avatar, rename, collapse
// trigger) and draws the divider under itself, so this re-declares none of it:
// `header` is typed as `CardHeaderProps` and spread, which means a header
// feature added to Card arrives here for free instead of drifting.
//
// It owns no size either. The Figma `size` axis (sm/md/lg) only changes the
// WIDTH (288/592/896), and every set is `HUG` vertically. So the height comes
// from the dashboard grid, and the widget just passes it down: the header takes
// what it needs, and the plot fills whatever is left (`flex-1 min-h-0` all the
// way down, so a chart given `size-full` occupies the rest of the card).
//
// Dropped into a parent with no definite height, `h-full` resolves to `auto` and
// the card hugs its content instead — so a standalone widget still works, with
// the chart bringing its own height.
//
// The per-type chart components stay card-less on purpose. They are the plot;
// the card is composition. That keeps `<AreaChart>` usable inside a table cell,
// a popover, or a `Metric`'s sparkline slot, where a card would be wrong.
//
// Figma: every chart set wraps the `Card` set (`10012:195993`) — ChartArea
// `8174:22232`, ChartBar `8700:55606`, ChartDonut `8811:172438`, and so on.
